Job Management & Invoicing System - Project Requirements

Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a custom job management and invoicing system tailored for freelancers or service providers who charge based on either a daily rate or a fixed project price. The system will help manage clients, projects, workdays, and automate invoice generation and sending.

Core Modules & Features

    Client Management

            Contact person (optional)
            Multiple email addresses
            One designated email for billing purposes

    Purpose:
        Helps organize client information and streamline communication for invoicing and updates.

    Project Management

    Requirements:
        Create projects based on:
            Daily rate
            Fixed project price

    Calendar & Workday Tracking

    Requirements:
        Interactive calendar view
        Select non-consecutive dates to indicate workdays
        System should count selected dates and calculate the total amount automatically using the set day rate
        Example: If the day rate is $200 and 6 days are selected (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th), the total is $1200.

    Purpose:
        Tracks real workdays without needing consecutive or full-week input, providing flexible tracking.

            Invoice number, date
        Export as PDF
        Option to send invoice via email to a selected address (e.g., billing department)

    Purpose:
